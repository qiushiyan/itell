## Coding environments

This is a hands-on textbook with lots of code snippets. Throughout the book, there will be a "Coding Time" section as shown below

<CodingTime>

This is a place for you to practice writing python code yourself. After you finish coding, you can click on the “Run” button to see the result of execution. For now, you don't have to edit anything in the editor above but to get familiar with this interface.

To execute the code below, press **Shift + Enter** or click on the <CircleEllipsisIcon className = "inline w-4 h-4" />  button on the left bar and press  <PlayIcon className = "inline w-4 h-4" />

    <Notebook script="preface/greet.py" />
