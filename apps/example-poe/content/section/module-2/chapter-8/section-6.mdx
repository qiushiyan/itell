<Keyterm label="adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)">
  a loan a borrower uses to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies
  with market interest rates
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="base year">
  arbitrary year whose value as an index number economists define as 100;
  inflation from the base year to other years can easily be seen by comparing
  the index number in the other year to the index number in the base year—for
  example, 100; so, if the index number for a year is 105, then there has been
  exactly 5% inflation between that year and the base year
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="basket of goods and services">
  a hypothetical group of different items, with specified quantities of each one
  meant to represent a “typical” set of consumer purchases, used as a basis for
  calculating how the price level changes over time
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="Consumer Price Index (CPI)">
  a measure of inflation that U.S. government statisticians calculate based on
  the price level from a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the
  average consumer's purchases
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="core inflation index">
  a measure of inflation typically calculated by ">taking the CPI and excluding
  volatile economic variables such as food and energy prices to better measure
  the underlying and persistent trend in long-term prices
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)">
  a contractual provision that wage increases will keep up with inflation

<Keyterm label="hyperinflation">
  an outburst of high inflation that often occurs (although not exclusively)
  when economies shift from a controlled economy to a market-oriented economy
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="index number">
  a unit-free number derived from the price level over a number of years, which
  makes computing inflation rates easier, since the index number has values
  around 100
</Keyterm>

  a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically for inflation
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="inflation">

  producers of goods and services
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="quality/new goods bias">
  inflation calculated using a fixed basket of goods over time tends to
  overstate the true rise in cost of living, because it does not account for
  improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods
</Keyterm>

<Keyterm label="substitution bias">
  an inflation rate calculated using a fixed basket of goods over time tends to
  overstate the true rise in the cost of living, because it does not take into
  account that the person can substitute away from goods whose prices rise
  considerably
</Keyterm>
